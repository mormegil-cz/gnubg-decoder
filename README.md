Gnubg Position ID/Match ID Decoder
==================================

This is an implementation of a decoder of position IDs/match IDs from GNU Backgammon.

It is a copy of an ancient PHP script I wrote in 2004. It is an adaptation of the HTML export code from gnubg implementation.

Maybe I'll get around to cleaning the script up or redoing in a better way.
